      <h1>Mission Statement </h1>
      <p align="justify">We are committed to nurturing academically, physically, emotionally and spiritually mature and responsible individuals ready to face life challenges with confidence. The  mission of the school is to prepare young people that will participate in the  decision-making process of our country and participate in national development. We  are working in unison for the emancipation of mankind from ignorance, poverty,  and diseases.</p>
<h1>Vission Statement</h1>
      <p align="justify">EGGUMS is to provide quality Christian-based Education for all students. It is prayerfully expected that those who benefit through this system of education will develop a deep sense of service and commitment to God and humankind as Christ teaches us to do.</p>
      <p align="justify">The  vision of the Elizabeth Gedi Garwo United Methodist Elementary, Junior and  Senior High School is to provide education to young people in the country. As a  service provider, our intent is to provide holistic education to young people  at different levels ranging from Early Childhood Education (ECE), Elementary Level  (EL), Secondary Education Level (SEL) and Senior High School Education Level  (SHSEL) with vocational and technical skills added to the liberal education.</p>
      <p align="justify">During  the five year period which commences from 2018 to 2022, we intend to modernize  the structure of the school by the construction of a library, laboratory,  computer laboratory and a workshop where students will practicalize the lesson  taught in class. Â We also intend to  engage in human resource capacity development which is critical to the achievement  of success in the operation of the school. Both human and infrastructure  development are critical to the wholesome development of the Elizabeth Gedi  Garwo United Methodist Elementary and Junior High School. Moreover, we intend  to also add classes within the period of five (5) years in order to reach a  full-fledged senior high school.</p>
      <p align="justify">Hence our desire to robustly engage in human  resource and infrastructure development leading to the establishment of the  full-fledged high school cannot be overemphasized. Indeed, we are of the strong  conviction that with the establishment of the various components mentioned,  supra, our vision and mission for building a vibrant institution will highly be  accomplished. </p>
