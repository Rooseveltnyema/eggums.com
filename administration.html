        <p>We  are highly grateful to the Almighty God for the opportunity we have to serve  our people in the educational sector. Our involvement in this venture is  indicative of our desire to see our young people adequately prepared in order  to make meaningful contributions towards the development of our country. We are  cognizant that education is critical to national development. Hence our quest  to operate a school significantly evolves from our vision to participate in the  human resource development of Liberia.</p>
        <p>Liberia  is our country. Therefore, we are under obligation to play our role in its  development. Our interest is to assist parents who are finding it difficult to  support their children in school due to financial difficulties. Our  intervention is to provide holistic training to young people, and prepare them  for future leadership of the church, community and the country.</p>
        <p>Our  desire to intervene in the provision of education to young people does not  suggest in any way that we are financially potent and can do everything  relating to their education to the extent that we need no assistance from  government or donors. Rather, we have a vision and a mission to accomplish. The  establishment of the school is the fulfillment of our vision. Hence, we are  relying on the cooperation, and support (both financial and moral) of the  government, parents, guardians, and other humanitarians to achieve our  objectives.        </p>
        <h1>The Principal's Message</h1>
        <p>At&nbsp;Elizabeth Gedi Garwo UMS, we are very  fortunate to have a&nbsp;<strong>dedicated, caring and hardworking team  of professionals (Teachers, Educational Assistants, Office Staff, Custodians,  and other school&nbsp;based)</strong>&nbsp;who work together to ensure  that every child has the best educational experience possible. Staffs  at&nbsp;Elizabeth Gedi Garwo UMS,&nbsp;always&nbsp;go above and beyond to  ensure that students are exposed to  a&nbsp;variety&nbsp;of&nbsp;activities&nbsp;to enhance and enrich their school  experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;last year in particular, staff&nbsp;put aside  their own worries and anxieties to ensure that our students had a safe,  predictable and fun school experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With the support of our  parent community, staff&nbsp;and students adjusted to rapidly changing Public  Health Orders, while maintaining a sense of routine, structure and  connectedness for students.&nbsp; Along with&nbsp;the challenges of living  through a pandemic,<strong>&nbsp;staff and students showed much  adaptability and resilience&nbsp;</strong>in  navigating&nbsp;the&nbsp;challenges of teaching and learning&nbsp;in the midst  of&nbsp;a&nbsp;seismic&nbsp;upgrade&nbsp;project, along with whole day power  outages,&nbsp;rapidly changing&nbsp;Public Health rules&nbsp;and regulations,  fire and building code deficiencies,&nbsp;and devastating news of around the  world.  Our&nbsp;<strong>students  deserve recognition</strong>&nbsp;for their passion for learning, as  well as their sense of humor.&nbsp;Students&nbsp;gave teachers a sense of joy,  purpose and positivity through challenging times.&nbsp;Through all the ups and  downs of the year,&nbsp;the  Local School  Board, Administration, Teachers, Students and Support Staffs  managed to maintain a sense  of&nbsp;connectedness&nbsp;and&nbsp;sustained&nbsp;caring and supportive  relationships.</p>
